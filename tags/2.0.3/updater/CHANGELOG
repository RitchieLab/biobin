CHANGELOG

2.0.1b3 (2013-05-02)
- updated pfam loader to 2.1 to handle the new release's file format
- fixed loki-build option --temp-directory to apply to SQLite temp files

2.0.1b2 (2013-03-21)
- fixed loki-build option --archive to skip re-archive if --cache-only is used

- fixed a bug in the updater which would mask the original error if the error-
  handler itself caused an additional error

2.0.1a1 (2013-03-05)
- added a source file metadata check to skip updates when the source loader
  code and all data files are unchanged since the last update
- new loki-build option --force-update to skip the metadata check
- separated the optimization and finalization of knowledge database files; the
  updater always optimizes at the end, but finalizes only by request
