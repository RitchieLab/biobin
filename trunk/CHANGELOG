== 2.3.1 ==

Changes:
- The -g/--genomic-build option is now required if the genomic build is not specified in the VCF file; BioBin will no longer default to using the genomic build of the LOKI database.

Bug Fixes:
- Samples which do not contribute to the test(s) on a bin due to missingness in the tested phenotype or any covariate are no longer included in the corresponding bin report.
- SKAT Linear and SKAT Logistic tests are disabled pending further testing and review.

== 2.3.0 ==

New Features:
- Genomic build is now detected from the VCF file when --genomic-build is not specified.
- Summary script output now includes case/control capacity and gene list, and is tab-separated by default.
- Changed the representation of p-values from SKAT methods in the case when they are very close to 0.
- Added option --bin-constant-loci to bin loci even when they do not vary among samples with non-missing phenotypes (default: N).
- Added option --drop-missing-phenotype-samples to drop samples which are neither case nor control for any phenotype (default: Y).
- Added option --force-all-control to consider all phenotypes as controls (default: N).
- Added option --ignore-build-difference to suppress the error when the specified genome build does not match the VCF (default: N).
- Added options --include-samples and --exclude-samples to specify files containing samples (one per line) to keep or filter out, respectively.
- Added option --set-star-referent to consider star alleles as referent rather than missing (default: Y).

== 2.2.1 ==

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a potential segfault when using roles and threading together

== 2.2.0 ==

Features and Changes:
- Added ability to run PheWAS, reading the VCF only once
- Compressed VCFs are automatically detected
- Added an output listing unlifted loci
- Added the ability to suppress summary information in the bins file
- Removed dependence on VCFTools library
- Removed Genotype and Frequency reports
- Removed all allele information from memory storage
- Added the ability to run statistical tests within BioBin.  Tests included:
	- linear regression
	- logistic regression
	- Wincoxon rank-sum test
	- SKAT (continuous phenotype)
	- SKAT (dichotomous phenotype)

Bug Fixes:
- Consider loci that lift to non-standard chromosomes as "unlifted"
- Correctly parsing variants including the "FT" genotype-level filter flag.
  Previously, all variants with a "FT" flag were incorrectly marked as monomorphic

== 2.1.2 ==
- Fixed reactome, GWAS catalog and liftOver loaders in LOKI.

== 2.1.1 ==

- Fixed bug that yields NaN for some bins when using locus weighting

== 2.1.0 ==

Features:
- Added weighting of individual loci in the collapsing methods
- Added ability to accept locus weights by region
- Added sliding-window intergenic bins
- Added a minimum MAF threshold to consider for binning.
- Added ability to filter genes/regions in consideration for binning.

Bug Fixes:
- Corrected bug in LOKI that produced incorrect annotations caused by upgrade to build 38

== 2.0.3 ==

- Fixed bug for using correct include paths for BOOST libraries

== 2.0.2 ==

- Moved "updater" to "loki" to make biobin closer in spirit to biofilter
- Updated method of building the LOKI database
- Caught errors when building the LOKI database so we don't have to "make clean" all the time

== 2.0.1 ==

- Updated and improved documentation

== 2.0.0 ==

Initial Release
