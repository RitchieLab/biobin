# BioFilter data
SETTINGS_DB	knowledge.bio

# List of vcf files associated with the data. Currently, biobin assumes a SNP occurs in only one file.
VCF_FILE        rand.vcf

# YES/NO gzipped VCF files.
COMPRESSED_VCF	NO

# Threshold associated with calling rare-variants.
MAF_CUTOFF	1

# List the various groups (by group ID) separated by spaces
#INCLUDE_GROUPS

# File containing group IDs to be the groups to be searched
#INCLUDE_GROUP_FILE

# List various groups (by name) separated by spaces. The name most be spelled EXACTLY as it is in the database.
#INCLUDE_GROUP_NAMES

# Set the population ID to match the population your data is drawn from so that
# LD patterns can be used to expand the gene boundaries.
POPULATION	NO-LD

# How many base pair locations up and down stream do we expand gene boundaries (Only used if POPULATION is NO-LD)

GENOMIC_BUILD	37

# Writes the bin counts to the file
WRITE_BIN_DATA	YES

# Writes the genotype counts to the file
WRITE_GENOTYPE_DATA	YES

# The string to be used to delimit fields in the data output (defaut is a single space).
OUTPUT_DELIMITER	'	'

# Phenotype file containing individual ID (space) phenotype value
#PHENOTYPE_FILENAME

# Generates a text report describing the bins as contained within the knowledge layout
WRITE_KNOWLEDGE_BIN_REPORT	YES

# Set threshold for bin collapsing.
BIN_COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD	200

# Write bin output using knowledge trees
WRITE_KNOWLEDGE_BINS	YES

# The number of kilobases intergenic bins can hold.
INTERGENIC_BIN_LENGTH	50

# The minimum number of SNPs a group or region must contain before stepping down into a finer resolution.
BIN_TRAVERSE_THRESHOLD	10

# The minimum number of SNPs a bin must have to be analyzed.
