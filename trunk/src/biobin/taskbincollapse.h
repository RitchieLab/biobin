 * This structure represents a two stage model: 1) it builds the association between
 * groups and bins and 2) it dumps each individual's data to the binfile. 
 * 
 * During construction of the group/bin associations, a text report showing
 * the hierarchical relationship between a group and it's child group/regions/snps
 * can be written. 
 * 
 * For circular references (such as seen in go), the parent group is removed from
 * it's progeny's children-so, the SNPs found in the parent will not appear listed
 * under the child's SNPs. The only place I can see a problem is where Group A
 * fails to pass some threshold (Biofilter or Biobin) and contains B which also
 * contains A. If A contains any SNPs itself, they will not be expressed-neither
 * through A nor B. If A does pass the threshold and is collapsed (or used to
 * generate models in biofilter) everything works fine-since the SNPs in B's circular
 * reference of A are already accounted for in A itself....
 * 
 * Bin Data -- I'm keeping the bin output here in the collapse structure because
 * I don't want to have to carry that data around for extended periods. Also, 
 * the bin data within the individual is atomic in natural and can be used to 
 * form the larger entities-so this is plenty flexible enough. So, the knowledge
 * based bin information will only exist during the file production.
